Hellllo, everybody. This is a written guide to go along with my video on the guide Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic in Widescreen tutorial. As we step into 2024, the gaming landscape has evolved, and so have the techniques and mods we use to enhance our favorite games. This guide is based on the collective wisdom of the folks maintaining the KOTOR Community Portal on Discord, so a massive shoutout to them for their incredible work.

**Getting Started**

First thing you need is a legally obtained copy of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. I'll be using the Steam version of KOTOR for this guide, but if you're using a different version, there are some steps that need to be take.

Disk Version Users: Download and apply the 1.03 patch https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1168-official-103-patch/
Amazon Version Players: A special sound and movies fix is required https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2377-amazon-gamess-k1-release-soundsmovies-fix/

If you are using a high resolution monitor, you need to turn off display scaling. Right-click on the desktop, select Display Settings, and set scale and layout to 100%.

One imporant note: if you plan to use the Kotor Community Mod Builds (you should), then you need to install them first. 

**Widescreen**

The first step is to locate and open your Kotor installation folder. 

For Steam Users:
  Right-click KOTOR in Steam.
  Navigate to Properties > Local Files > Browse.
  This action opens the SWKOTOR folder.

Once in this folder locate and launch SWCONFIG.EXE

Apply your settings like so: TODO

Then Click Apply to save your new configuration.

Next go back into your swkotor folder. Locate and open SWKOTOR.ini 
Open it with Notepad.
In the graphics options, update width and height to mirror your screenâ€™s resolution.

*Download*

Next we need to download a few files needed for widescreen

Download the Editable Executable from Deadly Stream:
Universal Widescreen (UniWS) available on Widescreen Gaming Forum:

After downloading extract the files into individual folders for easy navigation.
